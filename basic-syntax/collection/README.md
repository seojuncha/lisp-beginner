# Collection
There are two types of Common Lisp collections as other programming language.

- array type
- key-value type

No matter what collection is used, I think, the important thing is CRUD in a real world. For example, how to create a *vector* in Common Lisp? how to access an element? Is it same memory structure like C? Is there any build-in functions to maange those?

## array type collection
- vector
- list
- tuple

### vector
***vector*** in Common Lisp can be *fixed-size* and also *resizeble*.

### list

### tuple


## key-value type collection
- hash table
- associative array
- map
- dictionary
